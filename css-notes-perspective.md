***perspective makes the square look bigger when it moves closer to us, and smaller when it moves further away. Yes, just like in “real” life.***


We need to set the perspective property with a value. This value sets the distance from the object’s plane, or in other words, the perspective’s strength. The bigger the value, the further you are from the object; the smaller the value, the more noticeable the perspective will be.
